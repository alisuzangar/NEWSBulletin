This is a placeholder for the icon file. In a real application, you would need to create actual PNG image files for various icon sizes (72x72, 96x96, 128x128, 144x144, 152x152, 192x192, 384x384, 512x512).

For a production app, you would need to create these icon files using an image editor or icon generator tool. The icons should be properly sized PNG images with the appropriate dimensions.

For testing purposes, you can use any image and rename it to match these dimensions, or use an online icon generator to create a set of icons for your PWA.
